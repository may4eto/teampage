## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/may4eto/teampage/blob/master/Screenshot.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  https://may4eto.github.io/teampage/
- What was your experience?
  The challenge was to figure out a way to create the vertical offset, did it with nth child for every third element starting from the second one (nth-child(3n+2)) and then for every even element (nth-child(even)). Then I used a vertical translate on the selected elements.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I learned how to make images fluid and responsive by not using fixed sizes in pixels but width: 100% and height: auto.
- Your wisdom? :)
  Use rem instead of pixels for font sizes.
